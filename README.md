Matlab script. Computer Science univeristy project. 

Analizes sounds using the Fourier Transform. Firstly, it extracts the general transform, from where the frecuencies composing the sonud can be visualised. Secondly, it analizes samples packets for the purpose of graphising the partials evolution thorough the time. It may be used in the students lab (worked with PASCO Sonometers). It also offers a couple of sounds examples to analise directly from the file and  without using a sound interface.

All sounds used were downloaded from freesounds.org under the Creative Commons License
